    <p class="govuk-body-lead">Parental responsibility is a term that means you have legal rights and duties relating to
      your children's upbringing.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">It doesn't mean you have a right to spend time with your children (if you don't live with
      them), but the other parent must include you when making important decisions about their lives.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You're also responsible for issues such as:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>where they go to school</li>
      <li>how to discipline them</li>
      <li>agreeing to their medical treatment</li>
      <li>choosing, registering or changing their names</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">All mothers automatically have parental responsibility. A father usually does if he's either
      married to the child's mother or listed on the birth certificate.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You don't always need to get the consent of the other parent for routine decisions, even if
        they also have parental responsibility.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If it's a major decision (for example one of you wants to move abroad with your children)
        both parents with responsibility must agree in writing.</p>
