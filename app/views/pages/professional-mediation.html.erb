          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Shuttle mediation</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Your mediator may suggest that you and the other parent sit in separate rooms while the
            mediator
            'shuttles' between you. This is a good option if you'd prefer not to meet the other parent face-to-face or
            don't
            feel safe to do so.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Shuttle mediation is usually more expensive than standard mediation because it's a
            longer
            process.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Lawyer-assisted mediation</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">This is different to standard mediation because you and the other parent can both hire
            lawyers
            who attend sessions with you. Your lawyers can also help with shuttle mediation.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">As mediators can't offer legal advice you may want to choose this option if you have a
            lot of
            complex legal issues to resolve.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to consider the additional cost of a lawyer if you select this option.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Child-inclusive mediation</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">If your children understand your situation you can ask them to attend so a mediator can
            hear their wishes.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Talk with a mediator first about whether it's suitable to involve your children and
            remember to check if your children are happy to take part.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to make sure your mediator is qualified to offer this service before
            booking.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When mediation may not be suitable</h2>
          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Child abuse or neglect</h3>
