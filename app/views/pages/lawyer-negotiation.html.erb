    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"> Lawyer negotiation process</h2>

    <p>At the start of the process (also known as solicitor-led negotiation) your lawyer will set up a meeting with you
      to discuss the case. You'll need to explain your issues and the outcome you want to achieve.</p>
    <p>After receiving instructions from you, your lawyer will begin negotiations with the other parent or their lawyer.
      You won't have to deal directly with the other parent at any time.</p>
    <p>As in <%= govuk_link_to "collaborative law", collaborative_law_path %>
      both lawyers will try and keep the case from going to court.</p>
    <p>If your lawyers reach an agreement that you and the other parent are happy with they'll write down the details.
      If you both want to make the agreement legally binding they'll submit it to court for consideration and
      approval.</p>
